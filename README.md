# normal-study

HTML form and small backend created for Constant Therapy Summer 2016, to record data about users 
for a study.

This project helped me learn basics of Web Development (I made this website prior to any formal
web coursework). I learned how to use Bootstrap and jQuery. 

I also learned a bit about how best to ask for input from users, and how to effectively collect
information from people.
