# normal-study

HTML form created for Constant Therapy Summer 2016, to record data about users for a study.

This project helped me learn basics of Web Development (I made this website without any formal
web coursework), and about how to set up a data collecting device. I also learned about what
fields to ask for in the form, and how to best ask questions from users.
